Comments: We did not add an empty search test case because the search is essentially empty and nothing new will appear.
The site status will remain as it is

Comments:
We assumed that the search should be the same as what is written on the site,
regardless of capital or small letters, and when I search for anything else nothing appears,
but rather random results appear.
Therefore, there was a duplicate in the test code, which we eliminated according to our assumption
We assumed that the search would be completely empty and show results randomly when there was no search.
